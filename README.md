CS80 - Project Ed Anisko I want to build an app that manages my Dodger's season tickets. One component of this app will be a way to keep track of the dodgers schedule. For my project I will create a React App that uses create-react-app, react-bootstrap and axios to render all mlb games searchable by day. It will fetch data from the MLB broadcast api and display it. The code is on github at this url: https://github.com/edanisko/furry-waffle.git Thanks, Ed Anisko
